TauDEM (Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models) is a suite of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as represented by a DEM. 

The src folder contains source files
The TauDEM5MF folder contains the visual studio solution files.

More information will be forthcoming as I get a chance.

Details on the TauDEM software are at: http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem
