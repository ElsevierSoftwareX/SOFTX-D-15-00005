==Software Components==
- PABM: an illustrative software for scalable spatially explicit agent-based modeling (ABM).
- PGAP: a scalable parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) solver for the generalized assignment problem (GAP).
- pRasterBlaster: a high-performance map reprojection software, jointly developed by CEGIS@USGS (http://cegis.usgs.gov) and CIGI (http://cigi.illinois.edu).
- pPySAL: The Parallel PySAL library (https://github.com/pysal/pPysal) provides a set of scalable PySAL functions. Currently, pPySAL release includes the fisher-jenks algorithm.
- TauDEM: A high-performance software, developed by the Hydrology Research Group at the Utah State University (http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html), for watershed delineation and the extraction of hydrological information from topography.

====Software Environment====
CyberGIS Toolkit has been tested to run in the following software environment:
- Compilers: GNU, Intel
- MPI: OpenMPI 1.4.3, mvapich2 1.5.1, Cray MPI
- OS: CentOS 5.5 64bit

Please refer to each component's README/INSTALL document on how to compile and install them.

==Known Issues==
